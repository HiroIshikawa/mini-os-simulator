# mini-os-simulator

## 1. Process and Resource Manager
### Functionality:
- process : create / destroy; datastructure: PCB
- resource : request / release
- time-out interrupt : scheduling, cycle through different resources
- multi-unit resources : every unit would have more than one unit
- error checking : dealing with potential errors

### Simulation:
- without actual hardware, we simulate the process on terminal (input/output file)
	- currently running process and 
	- the hardware causing interrupts

### Organization:
- Shell
	- reads command from terminal or text file
	- invokes kernel function
	- displays reply ( termianl or output file)
		- running process
		- errors

Termianl / Test Files <--> Loop: Get command wirh args, invoke command with args, receive response, display response <--> Process / Resource Manager
